# Ottoneu

This is a repository of python functions to help me improve my Ottoneu play. 

Functions include:
- Daily Fangraphs scrape (with the help of a Cron job) for individual player projections for the day to optimize lineup choices
- 2020 point projections for all players to inform arbitration, keeper, and draft-day decisions
