# Ottoneu

This is a repository of python functions to help me improve my Ottoneu play. 

Functions include:
- Daily FanGraphs scrape (with the help of a Cron job) for individual player projections for the day, to help inform lineup choices
- 2020 point projections for all players, to inform draft-day decisions
